## Synopsis

This repository was created as a way to provide access to the script files that were create during the demonstration
videos within the Mastering Azure series presented by Packt Publishing. All files were written by the author and fully
tested within a standard Azure VS Code environment.

## Motivation

All of these scripts were created as part of the Mastering Azure - Infrastructure as a Service course being offered by Packt Publishing. Each script was walked through and presented at the end of each section of videos within the series. 

## Installation

Download the files to a local directory and then reference them inside of a Shell prompt.

## Built With

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) - Python based shell scripting for Azure
* [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview?view=azurermps-4.4.1) - The PowerShell framework for working with Azure
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The free IDE provided by Microsoft. It can provide a scripting development environment with integrated terminal for testing.
